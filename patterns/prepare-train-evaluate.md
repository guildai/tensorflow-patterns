title: Prepare, train, evaluate
scope: Workflow
summary: >

    Build scripts that can be used in discrete prepare, train, and
    evaluate operations.

---

TensorFlow scripts often support independent operations:

- Prepare
- Train
- Evaluate

The `prepare` operation obtains data (e.g. downloads) and prepares it
for training (i.e. any one-time preprocessing needed for training).

The `train` operation incrementally trains a model, saving it
occasionally as checkpoints and finally as a fully trained model.

## Example

``` python
print "TODO yo"
```
